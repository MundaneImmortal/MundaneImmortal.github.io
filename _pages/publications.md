## [Learn Discrimination From Contaminated Data: Multi-Instance Learning With Convex Representation for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection](../files/paper1.pdf)

* Author: Hu W., Liu Y.,**Xu J.**, Chen X., Wang G.
* Abstract:
  * Propsed anomaly discrimination learning with pseudo normality score generation and multi-instancecontrastive learning for distinguishing abnormal samples from the unlabeled set.
  * Combined the discrimination learning with mean-shifted contrastive learning and distribution-shiftingtransformation classification into a multitask representation learning framework to improve the stability androbustness of the training.
* status: Submitted to ICME 2022.
